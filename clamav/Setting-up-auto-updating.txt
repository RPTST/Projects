Setting up auto-updating
freshclam is the automatic database update tool for Clam AntiVirus. It can work in two modes:

    interactive - on demand from command line
    daemon - silently in the background

freshclam setup:

	# touch /var/log/freshclam.log
	# chmod 600 /var/log/freshclam.log
	# chown clamav /var/log/freshclam.log

Now you should edit the configuration file freshclam.conf and point the UpdateLogFile directive to the log file. Finally, to run freshclam in the daemon mode, execute:

	# freshclam -d

Setup crontab as root or clamav user: (crontab -e)

N * * * *	/usr/local/bin/freshclam --quiet

to check for a new database every hour. N should be a number between 3 and 57 of your choice. Please don't choose any multiple of 10, because there are already too many clients using those time slots. Proxy settings are only configurable via the configuration file and freshclam will require strict permission settings for the config file when HTTPProxyPassword is turned on.
